# FoodGuard-AI
## AI Food Freshness and Safety Detection System
# 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

FoodGuard-AI is an AI-powered food freshness and safety detection system that analyzes food images using computer vision and machine learning to identify indicators of spoilage such as color degradation, mold formation, and texture deterioration. The system classifies food into freshness categories (fresh, moderately risky, or spoiled) and provides instant, data-driven insights to help users make safer consumption decisions while minimizing unnecessary food waste. Developed for the international Google Gemini Live Agent Challenge, the project demonstrates the practical application of AI and cloud technologies in solving real-world problems by enabling users to perform quick food safety assessments through simple image analysis. Detailed project documentation and system architecture can be accessed here:





## System Workflow

1. **Image Input**
   - User uploads or captures an image of food.

2. **Image Processing**
   - The image is preprocessed using computer vision techniques.

3. **AI Model Analysis**
   - The machine learning model analyzes the image for spoilage indicators.

4. **Freshness Classification**
   - The food is categorized as:
     - Fresh
     - Moderate Risk
     - Spoiled

5. **Safety Recommendation**
   - The system advises whether the food should be consumed or discarded.

```
http://localhost:8000
```

---

## Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Frontend runs on:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

# 7. USAGE GUIDE

1. Launch both **backend** and **frontend servers**
2. Open the application in your browser
3. Upload or capture a food image
4. Click **Analyze**
5. View AI-generated freshness analysis

### Example Output

```
Detection Result
----------------
Food Item: Apple
Status: FRESH
Confidence: 94.3%
Recommendation: Safe to consume

Visual Indicators:
- No mold detected
- Natural color preserved
- Firm texture expected
```

---

## Classification Categories

| Category | Status | Action |
|--------|--------|-------|
| 🟢 Fresh | Optimal condition | Safe to eat |
| 🟡 Moderate Risk | Early spoilage signs | Consume soon |
| 🔴 Spoiled | Unsafe condition | Discard immediately |
